This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, bug in COBOL programs: data truncation.  The bug occurs when a numeric field is assigned a value exceeding its defined capacity. This example showcases how such an error can easily occur during arithmetic operations.  The solution illustrates a best practice to avoid this error by selecting sufficient field sizes for numeric fields based on the expected range of values to be handled. The focus is on the prevention of silent data loss that may not raise an immediate error, but can lead to significant calculation inaccuracies in the program.
